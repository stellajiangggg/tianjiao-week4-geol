# Sentinel Altimetry Echo Classification (Week 4 Assignment)

This repository contains code and instructions for classifying **Sentinel altimetry echoes** into **sea ice** vs. **leads** using **unsupervised learning** methods. The goal is to analyze echo waveforms, compute their **average shape** and **standard deviation**, and validate classifications against ESA's official labels using a **confusion matrix**.

## 📌 Assignment Objectives
- ✅ **Classify** echoes as **sea ice** or **lead** using **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering**.
- ✅ **Compute & visualize** the **average waveform shape** and **standard deviation** for each class.
- ✅ **Evaluate** classification performance using a **confusion matrix** compared to ESA’s official labels.
- ✅ **Share** the full implementation via a **GitHub repository with a structured README**.
